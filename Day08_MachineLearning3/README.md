# Announcements:
  - Friday: Panel with IGERT student at 12noon
  - Take some time at the end of the day to take the daily survey
  
# Goals

- Learn about machine-learning out-of-the-box tools
- Which model to use?
- End-to-end examples: supervised and unsupervised learning. (pipeline, cross validation)
- Learn about deep learning and deep learning frameworks

## Before you Begin
  - Commit your code locally
  - do a ```git pull```

## Intro
 
  - Why machine learning? It's in [the news!](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/541276/deep-learning-machine-teaches-itself-chess-in-72-hours-plays-at-international-master/) and [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk)
  - No, seriously, it's [everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence). And it's [not new](http://m.mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/LIX/236/433.full.pdf)
  
## End-to-end examples
  - python scikit-learn
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning

## Deep learning
  - What is it all about?
  - What is it good for? (And what is not)
  - Libraries and pointers.
  
## Beyond:
  - datatau
  - books 
  - Kaggle competitions
  - KDDNuggets
