# Announcements:
  - Friday: Panel with IGERT student at 12noon
  - Take some time at the end of the day to take the daily survey
  
# Goals

- Learn about machine-learning out-of-the-box tools
- Which model to use?
- End-to-end examples: supervised and unsupervised learning. (pipeline, cross validation)
- Learn about deep learning and deep learning frameworks

## Before you Begin
  - Commit your code locally
  - do a ```git pull```

## Intro
 
  - Why machine learning? It's in [the news!](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/541276/deep-learning-machine-teaches-itself-chess-in-72-hours-plays-at-international-master/) and [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYniJ0Rnk)
  - No, seriously, it's [everywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence). And it's [not new](http://m.mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/LIX/236/433.full.pdf)
  
## End-to-end examples
  - [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) [cheat-sheet](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/)
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning

## Deep learning
  - What is it all about?
  - Libraries: [caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), [torch7](https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet), [pointers](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html).
  - [RNN](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/), [LSTM](https://research.facebook.com/blog/1642778845966521/inferring-algorithmic-patterns-with-stack/)
  
## Beyond:

  - scikit-learn [extensions](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/related_projects.html)
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - [datatau](http://www.datatau.com/)
  - [KDNuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/)
  - [MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), [books](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)
