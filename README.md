# UCSBDataScienceBootcamp2015

This is a collection of material from the course IGERT Data and Network Science bootcamp, held at UCSB from 9/8/2015 to 9/18/2015.
The goal of the course is to introduce students of the IGERT program to data science. The data science methods and concepts presented will mainly be oriented to analyzing networks and networks science in general.
