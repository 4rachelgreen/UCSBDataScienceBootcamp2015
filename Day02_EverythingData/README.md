# Goals

- Learn about data science
- Learn how perform basic data manipulation with python
- See all the things that python can do

## Intro
  Always, before you begin:
  - Commit your code locally
  - do a ```git pull````

  - Why are we where today?
```
IGERT ⊂ network science ⊂ data science.
```
  - Recap of using shell, git, notebooks see: [here](../setup.md)
  - Data science, [what is it](..//Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/01%20-%20Data%20Science.ipynb)? Why is it [The Sexiest Job of the Century?](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/)

## Data Wrangling and Exploration

  - Python [basics](../master/Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/02%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Python.ipynb)
  - All Python [can do](../master/Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/03%20-%20Libraries%20and%20Integration.ipynb)!
  - Numpy and Pandas (the missing library for [data manipulation](../master/Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/04%20-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)
  - Speed (consideration)[../master/Day02_EverythingData/notebooks/05%20-%20Theory%20and%20Practice.ipynb]

## Data Exploration

  - Work with text, networks, time series. Import your dataset into python, and start playing with it.
