# Dynamical Systems

The goal of this module is to gain familiarity the theory of dynamical systems.

## Outline:

  - Introduction to dynamics
  - Why is it important to study dynamics on networks? 
  - First order dynamics - flows on a line
  - Linear vs nonlinear dynamics
  - Stability analysis -an intuitive explanation
  - Lyapunov equations - an intuitive explanation
  - Introduction to second order dynamics
  - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, stability
  - Introduction to bifurcations and hysteresis
