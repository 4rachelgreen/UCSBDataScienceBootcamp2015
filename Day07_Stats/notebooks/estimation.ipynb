In this section we will cover how to find the PDFs of these parameters."

    "Finding these PDFs is very useful! Say we have a bunch of cat heart weight measurements. We think they come from a normal distribution, but we want to know what the mean and standard deviation of that normal distribution is. There won't be an oracle that will tell us exactly, so the next best thing is to find the PDF of these random variables. If we have the PDF of $\\mu$ for example, we can find out things like what the most likely value of $\\mu$ is, how certain we are that $\\mu$ is close to that value, and probabilitiy that $\\mu$ is greater than 10 grams.
