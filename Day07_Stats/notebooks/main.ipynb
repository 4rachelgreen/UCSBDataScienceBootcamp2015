PDF's tell you what the probability is that a random variable will take on a certain value. In other words they you the probability of an event going down a certain way. If the event you're concerned with is the completion of a thesis and the random variable is number of years it takes, then the PDF could tell you that taking 4.5 years has a probability of 0.4, 5 years has a probability of 0.3, 10 years has a probability of 0.05, etc. Note that continuous random variables like the number of years it takes to complete a thesis  have PDFs, but discrete random variables like what number will face up when you roll a die have what's called <font color='red'>probability mass functions</font> or <font color='red'>PMFs</font>. This small detail is unimportant to know for this presentation, but is just a heads up for when you go out and read papers."
